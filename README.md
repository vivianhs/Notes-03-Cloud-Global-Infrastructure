Notes 03: Cloud Global Infrastructure

## Cloud infrastructure #
Describes the components and resources needed for cloud computing. You can create a private cloud by building it yourself using resources dedicated solely to you. Or you can use a public cloud by renting cloud infrastructure from a cloud provider like Alibaba, Amazon, Google, IBM, or Microsoft. And by incorporating some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across multiple clouds you can create a hybrid cloud.

The AWS infrastructure has been architected to be flexible and secure cloud computing environments. Is also designed to provide an extremely scalable and highly reliable platform that enables customers to deploy applications and data quickly and securely.

This infrastructure is built and managed not only according to security best practices
and standards, but also with the unique needs of the cloud in mind. AWS uses
redundant and layered controls, continuous validation and testing, and a substantial
amount of automation to ensure that the underlying infrastructure is monitored and
protected 24x7. AWS ensures that these controls are replicated in every new data
center or service.

Customers  get a resilient infrastructure, designed for high security, without the capital outlay and operational overhead of a 
traditional data center.
